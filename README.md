### **About Me!**
###### I am a third year student at Clemson University trying to get the hang of things in the world of computing! I find that overcoming obstacles (such as creating this webpage) is what makes me happy in life, and I always strive to get out of my comfort zone. When I am not doing schoolwork, you can find me hanging out with my friends, exercising, playing sports, or binging my favorite shows (currently it is Suits). 

### **My Goals as a Software Engingeer in Training**
- Create more based on my own interests
- Write readable, time efficient, error-free, and malleable code
- Incorporate UML, functional and non-functional requirments, and contracts
- Try to create software that aids others

### **Current and Upcoming Projects**
##### Renters Lease Renewal Program (TBD-TBD)
##### Much more to come!
